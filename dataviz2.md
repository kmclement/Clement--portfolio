## Description
All three visualizations display government debt around the world as a percentage of their gross domestic product, but each tell a different story. The first visualization, showcases a uniform number for each country in 2018. The full names for each country are displayed and they are all the same color. It's easy to see a quick comparison between all the countries in the list and the graph is simple to read and easy to find relevant information. The second visualization displays individual data for each country from 1995-2019. This helps if we want to see how countries have done over the time period. For example, Isreal had a spike in government debt in 2013. For the third data visualization, I chose to divide the countries by area of the world they are located in and order them from greatest to least government dept. Since the information I loaded into Flourish displayed country codes rather than complete names, I wanted another way to distinguish them from each other. I used colorbrewer2.0 to find five qualitative colors that looked good together. Unfortuneately, I couldn't figure out how to make a custom legend and the one that Flourish provided me showed each individual country as opposed to region.
