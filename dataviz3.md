## Description 

I selected this particular data visualization, because arts managers are extremely interested in how the arts recover after huge economic events. This is the most recent data for the health of arts organizations from the National Arts Index Reports, and I would find it interesting to see how the arts recover after the pandemic. Both recessions show a recovery afterwards, but one recovered quicker than the other.

  

I want to show how the arts in the United States recovered after both the 2001-2002 recession and the 2008-2009 recession. After the first recession, the arts steadily rose to its peak in 2007, right before sharply dropping during the 2008 recession. It then continued to drop before recovering again. I experimented using both bar and line graphs, but the line graph demonstrates the movement over time better than the bar graph, especially because it shows a connection between the years. I also simplified the colors from the original graphic and highlighted the recession years using different shading in the line graph, as opposed to red bars on a green background. Neither or my interviewees were arts administrators, but they both understood the impact of the economy on arts organizations. They both agreed that this information would help people who work in the arts- in both administration and finance. This helped me think to change the title to reflect the relationship between the economy and the National Index Score.

## Person #2: Amanda



  **What do you think this is?** This is a graph showing the health of arts organizations

**Can you describe to me what this is telling you?** It shows that the health changes according to the year and how the economy is doing

**Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?** I find it surprising that it recovered quickly after one recession and slowly after another

**Who do you think is the intended audience for this?** Financial analysts, arts administrators, investors, donors

**Is there anything you would change or do differently?** Shade in the background of the recession years once you add in color. It’ll really make them stand out.
