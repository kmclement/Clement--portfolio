## Part 1
### Outline 
I'd like to title my story, "The Classical Music Industry is so Rooted in Tradition that it Excludes its own Audience", showing the bias in the classical music industry by illustrating the United State's orchestral repertoire in the 2012-2013 season. This will be combined with a general overview of audience demographics compared with composer demographics. I plan to begin the story on a happy note with an overview of the most commonly performed composers in the United States. Many people can relate to hearing at least one of the composers as a child. I also plan to show where orchestras are located, combined with audience demographics of those specific areas. The "Aha!" moment will be a grid chart that displays all pieces performed that year, highlighting a small percentage of works by composers of color, female composers, and living composers. Finally, I'll compare the percentages and demographics of composers performed with demographics from orchestra locations. The call for action will be to ask local orchestras to play music by historically underrepresented composers. 

### Initial Sketches 
I plan to begin the story using something cheerful and relatable- a bar graph of the most popular composers performed in the United States. If I can and have time in the presentation, I would also like to be able to hover over the graph and have it play a clip from the composer's most popular work. Out of every composer mentioned, all of them but one were German men who died before 1940. I plan to have a color scheme with 2 contrasting colors- one for historically underrepresented composers and one for the popular composers. Since I would like the popular composers to be in the same color family, I plan to use multiple shades in the bar graph. Mozart, the most popular composer, will have the darkest shade.

My "Aha!" sketch will be a grid chart with every piece performed during the 2012-2013 season, highlighting the ones performed by underrepresented composers. The historically underrepresented composers will be shown in a bright color, while the most commonly performed composers will be in gray.

### The Data
I found the data from a [repertoire report](https://americanorchestras.org/orchestra-repertoire-report-orr-2012-2013/) by the League of American Orchestras. The data is organized by composer, orchestra group, concert programs, US Composers, composers within the past 25 years, and premier performances. I'll mainly be looking at the reports by composer and orchestra group, since I want to have an idea of how the orchestras are representing their communities. These reports are all presented as PDF's instead of excel documents, so I will import them into Adobe Acrobat and export them as excel workbooks. 

I will also be utilizing the [2010-2019 census estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-detail.html) and measuring demographics by state. The tables are all organized by state, so once I have a list of all orchestras, I will input demographics from each state to match up with their corresponding orchestras. 

### Method and Medium
I will use a scrolling page using Shorthand and use Tableau to create my charts. 

## Part 2

After discussing with my peers, I decided to narrow down the scope of my project to compare orchestra repertoire through 2019 and 2020. I will begin by describing the role of orchestras in our societies, showing a geographical representation of where some of the top Orchestras in the United States are located, and demonstrating who benefits from orchestras. I will then show the drastic contrast between the repertoire that is commonly performed and the repertoire that has been written. I will then show the demographics of where orchestras are located, comparing the demographics of composers performed with the demographics of the cities where the orchestras are located. 

## Target Audience
My target audience is musicians, classical music lovers, people who live in communities with orchestras, and classical music donors. Many people who listen to classical music already know that the industry is dominated by a select few composers, but I don't think they know the scope of the issue. 

## Wireframes
I created a series of hand written sketches as well as some initial drafts, using Tableau, Flourish, and Canva. 

## Storyboard
I created a rough draft of my Story on Storyboard.
