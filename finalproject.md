## Part 1
### Outline 
I'd like to title my story, "The Classical Music Industry is so Rooted in Tradition that it Excludes its own Audience", showing the bias in the classical music industry by illustrating the United State's orchestral repertoire in the 2012-2013 season. This will be combined with a general overview of audience demographics compared with composer demographics. I plan to begin the story on a happy note with an overview of the most commonly performed composers in the United States. Many people can relate to hearing at least one of the composers as a child. I also plan to show where orchestras are located, combined with audience demographics of those specific areas. The "Aha!" moment will be a grid chart that displays all pieces performed that year, highlighting a small percentage of works by composers of color, female composers, and living composers. Finally, I'll compare the percentages and demographics of composers performed with demographics from orchestra locations. The call for action will be to ask local orchestras to play music by historically underrepresented composers. 

### Initial Sketches 
I plan to begin the story using something cheerful and relatable- a bar graph of the most popular composers performed in the United States. If I can and have time in the presentation, I would also like to be able to hover over the graph and have it play a clip from the composer's most popular work. Out of every composer mentioned, all of them but one were German men who died before 1940. I plan to have a color scheme with 2 contrasting colors- one for historically underrepresented composers and one for the popular composers. Since I would like the popular composers to be in the same color family, I plan to use multiple shades in the bar graph. Mozart, the most popular composer, will have the darkest shade.

My "Aha!" sketch will be a grid chart with every piece performed during the 2012-2013 season, highlighting the ones performed by underrepresented composers. The historically underrepresented composers will be shown in a bright color, while the most commonly performed composers will be in gray.

### The Data
I found the data from a [repertoire report](https://americanorchestras.org/orchestra-repertoire-report-orr-2012-2013/) by the League of American Orchestras. The data is organized by composer, orchestra group, concert programs, US Composers, composers within the past 25 years, and premier performances. I'll mainly be looking at the reports by composer and orchestra group, since I want to have an idea of how the orchestras are representing their communities. These reports are all presented as PDF's instead of excel documents, so I will import them into Adobe Acrobat and export them as excel workbooks. 

I will also be utilizing the [2010-2019 census estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-detail.html) and measuring demographics by state. The tables are all organized by state, so once I have a list of all orchestras, I will input demographics from each state to match up with their corresponding orchestras. 

### Method and Medium
I will use a scrolling page using Shorthand and use Tableau to create my charts. 

## Part 2

After discussing with my peers, I decided to narrow down the scope of my project to compare orchestra repertoire through 2019 and 2020. I will begin by describing the role of orchestras in our societies, showing a geographical representation of where some of the top Orchestras in the United States are located, and demonstrating who benefits from orchestras. I will then show the drastic contrast between the repertoire that is commonly performed and the repertoire that has been written. I will then show the demographics of where orchestras are located, comparing the demographics of composers performed with the demographics of the cities where the orchestras are located. 

## Target Audience
My target audience is musicians, classical music lovers, people who live in communities with orchestras, and classical music donors. Many people who listen to classical music already know that the industry is dominated by a select few composers, but I don't think they know the scope of the issue. 

## Wireframes
I created a series of hand written sketches as well as some initial drafts, using Tableau, Flourish, and Canva.

## Storyboard
I created a rough draft of my Story on Shorthand.

## Interviews
I selected three participants from various backgrounds- a software engineer, an arts manager, and a classical musician- questions about both my story and the visuals that accompany my story. 

**Questions about my story**

 - Am I communicating my story in the most efficient way possible?
 - Do you understand the information?
 - Do my visuals go in hand with the story?
 - Is there a clear message?
 
 **Questions about my visuals**
 
 - Do my visuals make sense?
 - Are they appealing?
 - Is there anything you would change?

## Individual Interview No. 1:
I first spoke with Carl, a software engineer who works with data daily, but doesn't necessarily work with visuals. He played the clarinet before going to college, so he knows the basics of music. 
Comments// This seems like a cool project. I never realized that orchestras play so much of the same thing all the time. 
Suggestions// Remember to cite the source of the data into your charts. For your line graph, it drastically drops, so it looks like there were no new compositions after 2018, but that's probably when they stopped collecting the data. Can you filter the graph, so it ends before they stop collecting the data?

## Individual Interview No. 2:
Jon used to be a professional trombone player and has 2 conservatory degrees. He now works in the tech world and freelances on the side. 
Comments// I really like the map that shows where orchestras are. I didn't even realize that there are so many orchestras in the US that people could play in. Maybe you should clarify that the map doesn't count volunteer or school orchestras. The "most popular composers" chart makes so much sense. I like the square one better than the one with all the circles, but you should see how it goes with your overall theme of the presentation. I like the first photo with the statitics on it. You should add more of those. 
Suggestions// You should make everything the same color palette. On your "most popular composers" chart, can you change the color for living and dead composers, or come up with some sort of system so we can see differences in types of composers? I know musicians all know the names of these composers, but most people don't. 

## Indivisual Interview No. 3:
Amanda is an arts management student at Heinz College. She has a background in percussion performance and has worked in orchestra management. 
Comments// This could be an amazing resource for arts managers to show what little diversity the orchestra field has. I love the visual on the composers performed within the past year. I wonder if you can filter it, so we can see which characteristics of the composers that orchestras play. I'm less concerned about geographics and more concerned about the orchestra industry as a whole. 
Suggestions// I would take out the demographics map. I like the interactivity, but it doesn't add to your story, unless you can find a way to measure only the towns that the orchestras are in, but even then, I think it's too specific for the scope of your project. 

## What I changed 
I'm currently working on a new draft of the "most popular composers" chart that can filter out different characteristics of the composers. I've been experimenting with both Tableau and Flourish to make my visuals. I think Flourish is easier to use, but Tableau has greater capabilities. I will change the end date on the line graph. I'm considering taking away the demographics chart and solely focusing my story on composer diversity, rather than how orchestras are reflecting their communities.
