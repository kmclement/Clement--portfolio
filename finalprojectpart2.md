## Part 2

After discussing with my peers, I decided to narrow down the scope of my project to compare orchestra repertoire through 2019 and 2020. I will begin by describing the role of orchestras in our societies, showing a geographical representation of where some of the top Orchestras in the United States are located, and demonstrating who benefits from orchestras. I will then show the drastic contrast between the repertoire that is commonly performed and the repertoire that has been written. I will then show the demographics of where orchestras are located, comparing the demographics of composers performed with the demographics of the cities where the orchestras are located. 

## Target Audience
My target audience is musicians, classical music lovers, people who live in communities with orchestras, and classical music donors. Many people who listen to classical music already know that the industry is dominated by a select few composers, but I don't think they know the scope of the issue. 

## Wireframes
I created a series of hand written sketches as well as some initial drafts, using Tableau, Flourish, and Canva.

## Storyboard
I created a rough draft of my Story on Shorthand.

## Moodboard

## Interviews
I selected three participants from various backgrounds- a software engineer, an arts manager, and a classical musician- questions about both my story and the visuals that accompany my story. The software engineer has experience working with very large datasets and might point out something that somebody from an arts background might miss. The arts manager regularly sees the imbalance of repertoire in the orchestra world and could help give pointers about the actual story, since she lives it every day. The musician also knows about the imbalance of orchestral repertoire, but instead plays instead of programs it. The musician I chose to interview left the classical music world after facing discrimination and now works in the tech industry. All three participants have various degrees of interest in the classical music industry and knowledge about its faults. 

**Questions about my story**

 - Am I communicating my story in the most efficient way possible?
 - Do you understand the information?
 - Do my visuals go in hand with the story?
 - Is there a clear message?
 
 **Questions about my visuals**
 
 - Do my visuals make sense?
 - Are they appealing?
 - Is there anything you would change?

## Individual Interview No. 1:
I first spoke with Carl, a software engineer who works with data daily, but doesn't necessarily work with visuals. He played the clarinet before going to college, so he knows the basics of music. 
Comments// This seems like a cool project. I never realized that orchestras play so much of the same thing all the time. 
Suggestions// Remember to cite the source of the data into your charts. For your line graph, it drastically drops, so it looks like there were no new compositions after 2018, but that's probably when they stopped collecting the data. Can you filter the graph, so it ends before they stop collecting the data?

## Individual Interview No. 2:
Jon used to be a professional trombone player and has 2 conservatory degrees. He now works in the tech world and freelances on the side. 
Comments// I really like the map that shows where orchestras are. I didn't even realize that there are so many orchestras in the US that people could play in. Maybe you should clarify that the map doesn't count volunteer or school orchestras. The "most popular composers" chart makes so much sense. I like the square one better than the one with all the circles, but you should see how it goes with your overall theme of the presentation. I like the first photo with the statitics on it. You should add more of those. 
Suggestions// You should make everything the same color palette. On your "most popular composers" chart, can you change the color for living and dead composers, or come up with some sort of system so we can see differences in types of composers? I know musicians all know the names of these composers, but most people don't. 

## Indivisual Interview No. 3:
Amanda is an arts management student at Heinz College. She has a background in percussion performance and has worked in orchestra management. 
Comments// This could be an amazing resource for arts managers to show what little diversity the orchestra field has. I love the visual on the composers performed within the past year. I wonder if you can filter it, so we can see which characteristics of the composers that orchestras play. I'm less concerned about geographics and more concerned about the orchestra industry as a whole. 
Suggestions// I would take out the demographics map. I like the interactivity, but it doesn't add to your story, unless you can find a way to measure only the towns that the orchestras are in, but even then, I think it's too specific for the scope of your project. 

## What I Learned 
I'm currently working on a new draft of the "most popular composers" chart that can filter out different characteristics of the composers. I've been experimenting with both Tableau and Flourish to make my visuals. I think Flourish is easier to use, but Tableau has greater capabilities. I will change the end date on the line graph. I'm considering taking away the demographics chart and solely focusing my story on composer diversity, rather than how orchestras are reflecting their communities. I believe incorporating the communities into my story will make it much more broad than it needs to be. I will be adding more appealing graphics to my final presenation and writing more about the the background of the orchestral industry. The final graphs and charts will also match the color palette that I created in the moodboard.
