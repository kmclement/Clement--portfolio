## Writeup
 - changes from part 1, who/how I identified audience, narrow focus from interviews 
 
After interviewing my initial three participants, I decided I wanted to target people who already have a strong background in classical music, since my composer programming graph seemed to be my most powerful visualization. A basic knowledge about orchestral repertoire, popular composers, and what it’s like to play in an orchestra can be beneficial while reading the charts, since they all contain composer’s names. I believe the information is most influential for people who regularly perform in orchestras and who don’t think about the repertoire they regularly learn and perform, but it can also tell a powerful message to anybody who has some understanding of classical music. It can also give an insight to people who aren’t in the classical music world.

Instead of showing how the Orchestras represent their communities, I decided to showcase the need for decolonization in orchestras as a whole. When I tried to isolate the communities to where the orchestras were, I started seeing trends among specific orchestras instead of the industry.

For my second round of interviews, I focused more on individuals who have a classical music background who have performed in orchestras before. I first interview a 28 year old (m) horn player and music educator located in Fort Worth, Texas, who both freelances in area orchestras and teaches music in the Fort Worth Public Schools. He wasn't surprised that a majority of the repertoire performed was written by the same people, but he also agreed that all areas of the classical music industry need to decolonize, not just the "Bigger Name" orchestras that I depicted in my chart. I got particularly meaningful feedback my friend (25, f) from Undergrad and a student currently studying conducting in Studdgart, Germany, where orchestras only perform works by German men. She mentioned how both the students and conductors all mocked a well known French composer's works, since it didn't fit within their criteria.

After I morphed and narrowed down my topic and story, I needed to figure out the best way to display the Data. I wanted to make it accessible to everybody, not just people who know the names of all the composers, so I grouped together demographics- gender identity, race, and whether or not the composer is living-, so it’s clear to immediately see the difference between specific groupings and the most commonly performed composers, like Beethoven. I also experimented with some interactive charts using flourish, infogram, and tableau. I decided to stick with tableau, since I like the uniformity among the charts. I experimented with different placements of the subgroups. The charts looked cool when I placed them on the outside, surrounding the circle, but when I grouped them together into their own circle, it was much easier to compare them with the most popular composers, such as Beethoven and Mozart.
